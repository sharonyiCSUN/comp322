Sharon Yi CS 322 a.out - in this project we are given a 32-bit virtual address that holds a 4-KB page size. From here, the user will
type in ./a.out and a random decimal number to see which page that address would fall on and which offset as well. This helps the 
computer and program access physical memory addresses. The program uses division to see which page the inputted decimial is positioned
and it uses modulus to locate the offset of the virtual address.
